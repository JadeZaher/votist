		<p class="mb-6">
			The Votist mission is to create the world's most advanced technology for solution-oriented
			civic discourse. The internet is still a relatively new technology—one that has revolutionized
			how we connect, share information, and engage with the world. Yet, despite significant
			progress, we still lack a system specifically designed for solving complex problems
			collaboratively. Too often, digital communication fuels division instead of dialogue,
			misinformation instead of understanding. Votist is rethinking this model by introducing a
			structured, knowledge-based approach that ensures informed participation and productive
			debate.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our platform is built for those shaping the future—investors, planners, developers, creatives,
			leaders, and engaged citizens—offering a space where expertise is valued, collaboration is
			rewarded, and discussions lead to actionable solutions.

			The Proof of Concept (PoC): A New Approach to Public Discourse
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our PoC begins with a critical issue: the future of San Rafael's skyline. As the city
			navigates housing demands, infrastructure concerns, and historical preservation, Votist
			provides a structured way for residents, decision-makers, and investors to engage
			meaningfully. Unlike traditional comment sections or surveys, our model ensures that input is
			rooted in knowledge, giving stakeholders confidence in the legitimacy of public sentiment.

		<h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold text-[#1B4D5C]">How It Works: A Phased Rollout</h2>
		<p class="mb-6">
			The PoC will launch in phases, beginning with a research-driven approach. Initially, we will
			provide curated materials—videos, documents, and analyses of San Rafael's development
			projects—so participants have access to comprehensive background information. A quiz-based
			progression system will allow users to demonstrate expertise. While structured discussions
			will be introduced later, this first phase ensures engagement is built on a strong foundation
			of knowledge and accountability.
		</p>
		<p>
			What makes Votist different? Unlike traditional platforms that prioritize engagement or
			personal opinion, Votist is built for action. Credibility is earned, not assumed. Discussions
			are structured, not chaotic. And every interaction is designed to move toward real-world
			solutions, not just more debate.
