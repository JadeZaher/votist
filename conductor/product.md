# Votist - Product Guide

## One-Sentence Description

Votist is a civic participation experiment that uses light knowledge-gating and real-name accountability to produce a visible, structured signal of informed community sentiment on real policy questions.

## What Votist Is

Votist improves how communities understand themselves when facing difficult collective decisions. Instead of open comment forums, quick polls, or social-media debate, Votist introduces intentional friction — real-name accountability, shared context, basic factual grounding, and structured input — before people weigh in.

The goal is not to persuade participants toward a particular outcome, but to make informed values, priorities, and tradeoffs more visible. By slowing participation slightly and privileging clarity over volume, Votist surfaces a civic signal useful to residents, civic leaders, and decision-makers — without claiming to replace democratic processes or speak for everyone.

### Real-Name Accountability

A core design choice is the use of real names. Participation is tied to verified identity — not to signal expertise, credentials, or status, but to introduce a baseline level of civic accountability. Real-name participation reduces performative behavior, discourages abuse, and encourages people to speak as members of a shared community. Publicly, Votist displays only limited name information; identity functions as friction, not as a badge.

## Current Proof of Concept: San Rafael Housing

The PoC is a small pilot focused on one city (San Rafael, CA) and one policy domain (housing growth). Its primary purpose is to test a single core question:

> **Will people accept a modest, respectful knowledge gate before expressing a civic opinion — and does this produce a more useful civic signal?**

### PoC Participant Flow

1. **Sign in via LinkedIn** — Light real-name verification introducing civic accountability (not credentialing)
2. **Watch orientation video** — Short, neutral video outlining San Rafael's growth history and housing context, with optional links to related background materials and articles
3. **Complete knowledge check** — Brief qualifying quiz to establish a shared factual baseline
4. **Answer structured polls** — Three structured poll-style questions designed to surface values, preferences, and reasoning about how the city should grow
5. **View aggregate results** — Anonymized, read-only aggregate of community sentiment

### PoC Design Constraints

- **No comment threads, debates, scores, rankings, or weighted votes**
- Responses aggregated and shared in anonymized, read-only form
- Output is a clear snapshot of informed community sentiment — not a decision, not an advocacy directive, not a statistically representative poll
- Results may be segmented between San Rafael residents and non-residents where relevant
- Intentionally small and restrained — designed to be defensible, legible, and useful

## Target Users

- **San Rafael residents** — People directly affected by housing growth decisions who want to contribute informed perspective
- **Non-residents with interest** — People interested in the policy area who can participate (results segmentable)
- **Civic leaders and decision-makers** — Consumers of the aggregated civic signal
- **Civic organizations** — Groups facilitating community engagement around housing policy

## Problems Solved

1. **Uninformed civic opinion** — Traditional forums capture raw opinion without ensuring participants share a factual baseline; Votist gates participation behind shared context
2. **Performative civic discourse** — Anonymous or low-friction platforms reward volume and outrage; real-name accountability and intentional friction encourage thoughtful participation
3. **Invisible community sentiment** — Decision-makers struggle to understand what informed residents actually think; Votist produces a visible, structured signal
4. **Low civic participation quality** — Easy access without context leads to noise; modest friction filters for genuine engagement

## Key Features (PoC Scope)

- **LinkedIn sign-in** — Light real-name verification for civic accountability
- **Orientation video** — Neutral context-setting content before participation
- **Knowledge check** — Brief qualifying quiz establishing shared factual baseline
- **Structured polls** — Three focused questions surfacing values, preferences, and reasoning
- **Aggregate results** — Anonymized, read-only community sentiment snapshot
- **Resident/non-resident segmentation** — Results viewable by residency status
- **Research section** — Background materials and articles (WordPress-sourced) for deeper context
- **Admin panel** — Content management for quizzes, polls, and research materials

## Future Vision

Over time, Votist could evolve into a full civic participation system combining knowledge, contribution, and earned influence across many public issues:

- **Multiple domains** — Housing, transportation, governance, climate, budgeting, education, health, social policy
- **Deeper progression** — Users earn standing through sustained, constructive engagement: knowledge modules, thoughtful responses, respectful forum participation
- **Shaped discussion forums** — Conversations anchored to shared material, with participation privileges expanding as users demonstrate commitment and understanding
- **Civic knowledge commons** — A place where communities can see how informed perspectives cluster, how opinions shift with understanding, and where disagreement persists among people who share the same facts
- **Earned civic influence** — Influence tied to work done (learning, participating, returning) rather than popularity, volume, speed, or status

## Success Metrics

- **Participation acceptance** — Do people accept the knowledge gate? Completion rate of the full flow (sign-in → video → quiz → polls)
- **Signal quality** — Do results reveal meaningful structure in community sentiment? Variance across the three poll questions
- **Civic utility** — Do civic leaders and decision-makers find the output useful? Qualitative feedback
- **Informed engagement** — Quiz pass rates demonstrating genuine engagement with context material
