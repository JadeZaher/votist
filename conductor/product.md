# Votist - Product Guide

## Vision

Votist is a civic engagement platform that ensures informed participation by combining education, voting, and community discussion in a single unified experience.

## Target Users

- **Local citizens and residents** — People in specific communities (e.g., San Rafael) who want to actively participate in civic decisions affecting their area
- **Civic organizations and NGOs** — Groups that want to facilitate community engagement, run polls, and gather informed community input
- **General public** — Anyone interested in informed civic participation, community issues, and structured civic discussion

## Problems Solved

1. **Low civic participation** — Traditional civic processes are inaccessible or uninviting; Votist makes participation easy and engaging through a modern web platform
2. **Uninformed voting** — Voters often lack context about the topics they're deciding on; Votist's quiz progression system ensures voters demonstrate understanding before casting votes
3. **Fragmented civic tools** — Voting, education, and discussion are typically scattered across different platforms; Votist unifies them into a single cohesive experience
4. **No structured community discussion** — There's no dedicated space for constructive civic discourse; Votist provides posts, comments, and threaded discussions tied directly to voting topics

## Key Features

- **Quiz Progression System** — Three difficulty tiers (Votist, Scholar, Mentor) with roadmap-style progression; users must pass quizzes to unlock voting privileges on related topics
- **Polls & Voting** — Community polls attached to posts with configurable difficulty requirements for participation
- **Posts & Discussion** — Content creation with comments, likes, and threaded replies for structured civic discourse
- **User Progress Tracking** — Track quiz completions, scores, and voting history per user
- **Admin Panel** — Manage quizzes, questions, and posts through a dedicated admin interface
- **Location-Based Voting** — Support for community-specific voting pages (e.g., San Rafael)
- **Research Section** — Educational content and research articles to inform voters

## Success Metrics

- **Informed decisions** — High quiz completion rates demonstrating voter knowledge before participation
- **Discussion quality** — Constructive, substantive community discussions with meaningful engagement (comments, replies, likes)
- **Active voter engagement** — Growing percentage of users completing the education-to-voting pipeline
